Power BI Dashboard showing the results of a survey completed by 630 data professionals

Exploring insights from Alex the Analyst's 2022 Data Professional Survey, my Power BI project delves into the perspectives of 603 professionals across six job titles and four countries. 

By meticulously cleaning the data in Power Query, I unveiled intriguing trends: while many express dissatisfaction with their salary, they're generally content with work/life balance a notable discovery considering these are primary motivators for joining the field. 

Additionally, I dissected the aspirations of respondents, revealing a common desire for improved compensation in their next roles. 

Looking ahead, I aim to enhance the analysis by incorporating mean lines to salary graphs, providing clearer context on average salaries across roles and regions.
